# Add File

## Description
Adds a file and corresponding testing file to the current working directory. 
Will create a __tests__ file if not already present.


## How To Use

in the command line run the command `addfile`

then pass after the `-n` or `--name` flag the name of the file you want to create
then pass after the `-t` or `--type` flag the file extension. 

The CLI tool will create a file with the name you give it (along with some boilerplate code) as well as a test file that imports your file.
